    <h1>Crispy Pepperoni Chicken</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1½ to 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, patted dry</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed, plus more as needed</li>
      <li>½ lemon or 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>2 ounces pepperoni, coarsely chopped (about ½ cup)</li>
      <li>½ cup panko or dried coarse bread crumbs</li>
      <li>¼ cup finely chopped parsley (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>If using chicken breasts, pound them to an even ½-inch thickness with a skillet or meat pounder.</li>
      <li>Season chicken lightly with salt and pepper. In a large (12-inch) skillet, heat the oil over medium-high. Working in batches if needed, add the chicken and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until cooked through, 2 to 5 minutes more.</li>
      <li>Transfer chicken to a platter and squeeze lemon over the top.</li>
      <li>Wipe or rinse out the skillet if needed. Return to medium heat and cook the pepperoni, stirring often, until it starts to brown and release oil, about 2 to 4 minutes. Add the bread crumbs and cook, stirring often, until crisp and golden, 2 to 4 minutes. If the pan gets dry, add more oil. Stir in parsley, if using, and spoon the crumb mixture over the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
