  <h1>Creamy Chicken and Mushroom Stroganoff</h1>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul class="ingredients">
    <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
    <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
    <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Greek seasoning</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
    <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>½ cup milk</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol class="instructions">
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat; stir in onion and mushrooms. Reduce heat and cook until onions release their liquid and mushrooms soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Season chicken strips with Greek seasoning and black pepper. Add to the skillet and cook until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook noodles until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pour chicken broth, milk, and Worcestershire sauce into the skillet. Slowly stir in sour cream, one tablespoon at a time. Spoon out a small amount of sauce and whisk with flour in a bowl until smooth. Stir the flour mixture back into the sauce; simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve over egg noodles and garnish with parsley.</li>
  </ol>
