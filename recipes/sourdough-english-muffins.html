    <h1>Sourdough English Muffins</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup (100 g) active sourdough starter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon (20 g) honey (sugar or maple syrup)</li>
      <li>1 cup (240 g) milk</li>
      <li>3 cups (360 g) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon (5 g) fine sea salt</li>
      <li>¼ cup (40 g) cornmeal (for sprinkling)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Make the Dough</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Add 100 g of the active starter and the rest of the ingredients (except cornmeal) to a large bowl. Use your hands to mix until well combined. Cover and let rest 30–60 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead by hand for 5 minutes. (A stand mixer with a dough hook can also be used on the lowest speed.)</li>
      <li>Place the dough back into the bowl, cover, and let ferment on the counter at room temperature for 8–12 hours. (Room temperature should be 65–70°F.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cut and Cook</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, flour the top, and press it out with your fingertips until ½" thick.</li>
      <li>Use a 3" biscuit cutter to cut rounds and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. Sprinkle the tops with cornmeal, cover with a tea towel, and allow to rise for 1 hour at room temperature.</li>
      <li>Preheat a non-stick skillet over low heat. Place 4 muffins into the skillet, spaced 2" apart. Cover and cook the first side for 4 minutes. Turn and cook an additional 4 minutes, until the center reaches about 200°F on an instant-read thermometer.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Make the dough the night before, then get up early and cut the muffins. Let them rise an hour or so and then cook in a pan.
