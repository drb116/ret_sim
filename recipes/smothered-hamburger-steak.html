    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon packed dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>Â½ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 pounds lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
      <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can water</li>
      <li>1 dash Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the steaks: Add the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, brown sugar and egg; season generously with salt and pepper and whisk to combine. Add the ground beef and panko, and with a spoon or fork, gently stir the mixture to combine without overmixing. Form into 8 small, oval-shaped patties about 1 inch thick, place on a plate and into the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes to firm up.</li>
      <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry patties until browned and no longer pink in the center, about 8 minutes per side. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Remove grease from skillet. Whisk together mushroom soup, water, and Worcestershire sauce until smooth. Return patties to skillet, spoon sauce over top, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and cook 20 minutes until sauce thickens.</li>
    </ol>
