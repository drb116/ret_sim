    <h1>Pad Prik King (Red Curry Chicken and Green Beans)</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
      <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into ½-by-2-inch strips</li>
      <li>¼ cup canola or vegetable oil</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>3 to 4 tablespoons red curry paste</li>
      <li>8 ounces long beans or green beans, cut into 1-inch segments (about 2 cups)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons oyster sauce (preferably Thai)</li>
      <li>1½ teaspoons sugar</li>
      <li>12 makrut lime leaves, thinly sliced crosswise</li>
      <li>Cooked jasmine rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a medium bowl, stir together 2 tablespoons of water with the cornstarch and salt. Add the chicken and mix vigorously to coat.</li>

      <li>Heat the oil in a wok or large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the curry paste and mash into the oil until fragrant, darkened, and starting to crumble, about 3 minutes.</li>

      <li>Add the chicken mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes.</li>

      <li>Stir in the long beans, oyster sauce, and ¼ cup water. Cook, stirring occasionally, for another 3 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Add the sugar and lime leaves and cook for 1 more minute. Serve over jasmine rice or with rice on the side.</li>
    </ol>
