    <h1>Spicy Creamy Weeknight Bolognese</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef (at least 20% fat)</li>
      <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 carrots, peeled and finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 to 3 tablespoons red curry paste</li>
      <li>1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 pound short, curled pasta (such as pipettes)</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>

      <li>Meanwhile, heat a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over high heat. Add the beef and spread it into a single layer. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then cook, stirring to break into small bits, 4–5 minutes until browned and cooked through.</li>

      <li>Push the beef to one side and add the onion and carrots. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>

      <li>Add the curry paste (2 tablespoons for mild heat, 3 for more spice) and stir until darkened, about 2–3 minutes. Pour in the tomato sauce, then fill the can one-third with water and add to the pot. Stir, bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and let simmer while the pasta cooks.</li>

      <li>Cook the pasta in the boiling water until al dente. Reserve ½ cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta and add it to the simmering sauce.</li>

      <li>Stir in the heavy cream, taste, and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. For a thinner sauce, add a bit of the reserved pasta water. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>

    <p> Not a favorite of the kids, but try again. It has a unique taste with the curry.
