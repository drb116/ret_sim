    <h1>The Best Dinner Rolls</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup warm milk (110°F)</li>
      <li>2¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3½ to 4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Additional melted butter for brushing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a small bowl, combine warm milk, yeast, and a pinch of sugar. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes until foamy.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl or mixer, add sugar, egg, butter, and salt. Mix until smooth. Add the yeast mixture and stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Gradually add flour, one cup at a time, until a soft dough forms. Knead 6 to 8 minutes, until smooth and elastic.</li>
      <li>Place dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Punch down the dough and divide into 12–15 equal portions. Shape into balls and place in a greased 9×13-inch pan.</li>
      <li>Cover and let rise again until doubled, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>Bake at 375°F for 15–18 minutes, until golden brown. Brush warm rolls with melted butter before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Comments</h2>
    <p>I make half the recipe and then make into anywhere from 8 to 12 rolls. The second rise often can take as much as 2 hours. Do not cook on an aluminum pan.</p>
