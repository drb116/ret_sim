    <h1>Pretzel Rolls</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups warm water (about 110°F)</li>
      <li>1 packet (2¼ teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
      <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>10 cups water</li>
      <li>⅔ cup baking soda</li>
      <li>1 egg yolk, beaten with 1 tablespoon water (for egg wash)</li>
      <li>Coarse salt, for sprinkling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy.</li>
      <li>Add flour, salt, and melted butter. Mix until a soft dough forms, then knead on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, until smooth and elastic.</li>
      <li>Place dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Punch down dough and divide into 8 equal portions. Shape each piece into a smooth ball and place on prepared sheets. Cover with a towel and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Bring 10 cups of water and baking soda to a boil in a large pot. Boil each roll for 30 seconds, turning halfway. Remove with a slotted spoon and place back on baking sheets.</li>
      <li>Brush with egg wash, sprinkle with coarse salt, and score an “X” on top of each roll with a sharp knife.</li>
      <li>Bake for 15–18 minutes, until deep golden brown. Cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
