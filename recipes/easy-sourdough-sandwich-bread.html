    <h1>Sourdough Sandwich Bread</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>100 grams (about ½ cup) active starter</li>
      <li>10 grams (about 2.5 teaspoons) kosher salt</li>
      <li>400 grams water (room temperature)</li>
      <li>512 grams (4 cups) bread flour</li>
      <li>A few tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Room temperature butter, for greasing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Mix the dough:</strong> Place the starter, salt, and water in a large bowl. Stir with a spatula to combine. Add the flour and mix again until the flour is completely incorporated. Transfer the dough to a straight-sided vessel if possible to better monitor the rise.</li>

      <li><strong>Perform one (or more) “stretches and folds”:</strong> 30 minutes after mixing, reach into the bowl and pull the dough up and into the center. Turn the bowl a quarter turn and repeat 8–10 times. Repeat this folding step every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours if time allows.</li>

      <li><strong>Let it rise:</strong> Drizzle with a splash of olive oil, rub to coat, cover the bowl, and let rise at room temperature (70°F/21°C) for 4–18 hours. When the dough has increased by about 50% in volume, it’s ready. Avoid using an oven with the light on, as it may be too warm.</li>

      <li><strong>Prepare the pan:</strong> When the dough has nearly doubled, grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan (or 10×5-inch) with butter or nonstick spray.</li>

      <li><strong>Let it proof:</strong> Drizzle the dough with olive oil, then gently release it from the bowl. Shape into a rectangle, then roll up seam-side down and transfer to the prepared pan. Cover and let proof 5–6 hours, or until dough reaches the rim of the pan. (You can refrigerate overnight if needed.)</li>

      <li><strong>Bake it:</strong> Preheat oven to 425°F. Bake for 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 375°F and bake another 20–25 minutes, until golden and internal temperature reaches 206–210°F. Cool at least 30 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The water is cut down to 400, but in drier climates you may need to increase slightly. I stretch with a dough hook.
