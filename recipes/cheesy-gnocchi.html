  <h1>Cheesy Gnocchi with Corn and Pesto</h1>
  <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 4 servings</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul class="ingredients">
    <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 pound shelf-stable gnocchi</li>
    <li>About 3 cups canned or fresh corn kernels (from two 15-ounce cans or about 4 fresh cobs)</li>
    <li>Â½ cup store-bought or homemade pesto, plus more for topping</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>8 ounces grated whole-milk, low-moisture mozzarella</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol class="instructions">
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until sizzling hot, about 2 minutes. Add the gnocchi and sear, undisturbed, for 4 minutes, until crispy underneath.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the corn and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes, until softened. Remove from the heat.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Stir in the pesto. Season with salt as needed, and add a few cracks of black pepper.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Place an oven rack underneath the broiler. Set the broiler to high.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Top the gnocchi and corn with the cheese. Place the skillet underneath the broiler and broil for about 4 minutes, until the cheese is completely melted and slightly charred on top.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Top with more pesto and divide among bowls.</li>
  </ol>

    <p>This was a hit, but need a strong side dish if you are going to make it for 4. Quick and easy option for dinner.</p>
