    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, chopped</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 cups Arborio rice</li>
      <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>4 ½ cups chicken stock</li>
      <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 sprig fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot), and select Sauté function on normal setting according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</li>
      <li>Mix oregano, thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Season chicken with spice blend.</li>
      <li>Heat 1 tablespoon butter and olive oil in the pressure cooker until melted. Quickly brown chicken on all sides, about 3 minutes. Remove chicken. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove onion and garlic from the pot.</li>
      <li>Melt a second tablespoon of butter in the pot, add rice, and stir constantly until fully coated and toasted, about 3 minutes. Pour in wine and scrape up browned bits. Cook until wine is absorbed, about 2 minutes. Add chicken stock, chicken, onion mixture, and mix until combined. Turn off Sauté.</li>
      <li>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure and set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
      <li>Release pressure carefully using quick-release method according to the manufacturer’s instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Stir Parmesan cheese and remaining tablespoon of butter into the risotto. Season with salt and pepper, garnish with parsley, and serve.</li>
