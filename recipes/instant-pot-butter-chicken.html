    <h1>Instant Pot Butter Chicken</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic, minced or crushed (about 5 teaspoons)</li>
      <li>2 inches fresh ginger root, grated (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon chili powder (optional)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt (add more if needed)</li>
      <li>2 pounds chicken thighs, skinless and boneless, diced into bite-size pieces</li>
      <li>1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce or passata</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream (or coconut milk, or half and half)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or cilantro, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>On the Instant Pot, press SAUTE and melt the butter. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>

      <li>Add all of the spices and salt, stir, and cook for 1 minute. If the mixture sticks to the bottom, add a splash of water to deglaze. Then add the tomato sauce and ¼ cup of water. Turn off the sauté setting.</li>

      <li>Add the chicken thighs and stir to combine.</li>

      <li>Secure the lid and set the vent to SEALING. Select PRESSURE COOK or MANUAL, and set to cook for 6 minutes at high pressure. The pot will take around 10 minutes to come to pressure. Once finished, quick release the steam.</li>

      <li>Carefully remove the lid and press SAUTE. Stir in the cream and let the sauce reduce slightly. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Serve warm over rice, garnished with parsley or cilantro.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>1. Do not add water — the chicken will release enough liquid for the Instant Pot to come to pressure (if worried about a BURN message).</p>
    <p>2. Chicken breasts can also be used, though thighs are more flavorful and tender. If using chicken breasts, pressure cook for 5 minutes.</p>
    <p>3. This usually takes a long time to boil down once complete. Plan on 20 to 30 extra minutes.</p>
