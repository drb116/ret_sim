    <h1>Pumpkin Crumb Cake</h1>

    <h2>For the Streusel</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup (100 g) light brown sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup (64 g) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon pumpkin spice blend</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt</li>
      <li>¼ cup (56 g) unsalted butter, cold and cut into cubes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>For the Pumpkin Cake</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 cup (200 g) light brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup (230 g) canned pumpkin purée</li>
      <li>¼ cup (56 g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>¼ cup neutral oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon pumpkin spice blend</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1½ cups (190 g) all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>For the Glaze (Optional)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup (75 g) confectioners’ sugar</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon pumpkin spice blend</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt</li>
      <li>3 to 5 teaspoons milk (any kind)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 350°F. Spray an 8-inch square or 9-inch round baking pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Make the streusel: In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, flour, pumpkin spice, and salt. Add the butter and pinch it into the flour mixture with your fingertips until the mixture forms coarse crumbs.</li>
      <li>Make the cake: In a large bowl, whisk the sugar and eggs until pale and foamy, about 1 minute. Add the pumpkin purée, melted butter, oil, pumpkin spice, and salt; whisk until smooth. Whisk in baking powder and baking soda, then whisk in the flour.</li>
      <li>Transfer the batter to the prepared pan, smooth the top, and tap on the counter to remove air bubbles. Sprinkle the streusel evenly over the top.</li>
      <li>Bake until puffed and golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40–45 minutes. Cool in the pan on a rack for 15 minutes, then remove from the pan and cool almost completely.</li>
      <li>When slightly warm, make the glaze (if using): Whisk confectioners’ sugar, pumpkin spice, salt, and 3 teaspoons milk until smooth. Add more milk as needed for a thick but pourable consistency.</li>
      <li>Drizzle the glaze over the top of the cake.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Don't skip the glaze and don't worry about measuring. Just make it so that it is as 
      thick as possible, but still pours.
