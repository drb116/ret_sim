  <h1>Grandma’s Hamburger Casserole</h1>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul class="ingredients">
    <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
    <li>¼ cup red wine</li>
    <li>2 (15-oz) cans tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1 tsp white sugar (or to taste)</li>
    <li>1 tsp garlic powder (or to taste)</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp basil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp oregano</li>
    <li>2 tsp parsley</li>
    <li>10-12 oz egg noodles</li>
    <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>4 oz cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>½ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese (or more to taste)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol class="instructions">
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly (about 5 – 7 minutes); drain and discard the grease.</li>
    <li>Add red wine and reduce to about half.</li>
    <li>Mix in the tomato sauce, sugar, garlic, salt and other spices into the ground beef; simmer until flavors blend (about 20 minutes). Remove from heat and cover the skillet.</li>
    <li>While simmering, mix together the sour cream, cream cheese, and diced onion in a bowl.</li>
    <li>While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but still firm to the bite (about 7 – 9 minutes). Drain.</li>  
    <li>Layer ½ of the cooked egg noodles into the prepared casserole dish. Top with ½ of the sour cream mixture, then ½ of the ground beef mixture. Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle the shredded sharp Cheddar cheese over the top.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven at 350 °F until the cheese is melted and golden brown (about 25 – 30 minutes).</li>
  </ol>
